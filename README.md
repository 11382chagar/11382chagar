- 👋 Hi, I’m Charlie, thanks for stopping by.
- 👀 I’m interested in: Swimming, biking, running (and frankly most other sports that require a certain level of suffering...weird I know!), reading, finance, economics, politics and history (big history nerd!).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Data analytics, inference and machine learning using SQL, Python, R and Tableau. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: When my contributions would be of value, I'd be interested in collaborating on financial, investment and economic models and applications.
